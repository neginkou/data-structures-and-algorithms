# Challenge Title

## Stacks and Queues


## Approach & Efficiency

The approach for implementing the Queue and Stack data structures involves using a linked list.

For both Queue and Stack:

Enqueue (add) and dequeue (remove) operations have O(1) time complexity.
Peek (view the top/front element) operations also have O(1) time complexity.
Checking if they are empty is an O(1) operation.
