# Challenge Title

## Tree-fizz-buzz

## Whiteboard Process

![WhiteBoard](WhiteBoard.png)

## Approach & Efficiency

Approach:
I recursively traverse the original k-ary tree, applying FizzBuzz rules to create a new tree with modified values.

Big O Time Complexity:
O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the original tree.

Big O Space Complexity:
O(N) due to the recursive calls and space needed for the new tree.
